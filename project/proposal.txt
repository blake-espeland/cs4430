UTM Name: Ms. Universe


Blake Espeland and Krishna Pratti


Debugging Tool:
We plan on implementing a function that resembles 'accept' for TM's, only it 
stores each transition used when parsing the input string and returns it as a 
list.

	Something like this:
	debug :: UniversalTM -> String -> [String]
	debug utm input = ...

	ghci: debug MsUniverse input
	>> ["0100,110010,1,1110,001100", "1110,001100,...", ...]


Algorithm:
Drawn and attached in the folder as MsUniverseAlgo.pdf
Note: the stored state will need to be cleared before copying over the transition state.
	  Also, some of the steps will likely become functions of their own. For sake of brevity,
	  I've only included a synopsis of their function. We don't plan on changing the encoding.
