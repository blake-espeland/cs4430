As we were working on the transition diagram for the TM, we noticed that the encoding for different characters were of different length.  So, we had to change the encoding make it more uniform. Chars and states are now encoded as 8 bit strings, and directions remain the same (1 bit). This made the process of reading/writing states much easier. We're almost done sketching out the desired transition diagram, and about halfway finished implementing it in code. We're taking the approach of splitting the relatively long pieces of transitions into individual functions and connecting them. This has makes isolating the individual components simpler. Along with that, each "section" is a function that has relative state indexing, meaning they can be placed anywhere. Each section takes in an input of an integer (start state) and outputs a list of transitions. In essence, we're trying to build a TM made of smaller TM's. The debugging function will likely be the hardest part, and we're thinking of impementing something different from what we outlined on the proposal. Instead, we're going to just print out an annotated version of the UTM tape that tells us where the readhead is at each state.
